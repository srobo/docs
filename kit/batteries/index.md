Batteries and Charging
======================

![Three cell, 2200mAh, lithium-ion polymer battery](/images/content/kit/battery.png "Three cell, 2200mAh, lithium-ion polymer battery")

The electronics kit contains two lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries.
These are similar to those used in laptops, and are small and light for the amount of energy they contain.
This is great for your robot but it is vital to treat such a high concentration of energy with respect.
If you do not, there is a serious risk of fire, injury, and even death.
To avoid this, you should follow the safety information on this page closely, at all times.

Your kit will come with several pieces of battery related equipment:

1. Two 11.1V 2200mAh LiPo Batteries.
2. One battery charger.
3. One battery charging bag.

You must **not** use any batteries, chargers, bags or cables not explicitly authorised by Student Robotics.
If in doubt, please contact <info@studentrobotics.org>.

If damaged, LiPo batteries will swell and appear to bulge in their casing.  If
you notice that a battery has swollen, you should immediately disconnect it, and
place it in a dry container, preferably outside. Contact
<info@studentrobotics.org> to discuss how to dispose of it.

Storing Batteries
-----------------

When your batteries are not actively in use, they should be safely stored. You
must disconnect the batteries from all electrical equipment, and place them in
the battery charging bag. You should then store the charging bag in a safe
location.

If you are not going to use the batteries for a long period of time, such as
more than a week, then you should charge the batteries before hand. By
themselves, batteries will discharge very slowly, and over-discharging will
lead to damage. We recommend that you charge all batteries to at
least 70% of capacity before being stored for a long period.

Operating Batteries
-------------------

To use your batteries, you must connect them to the Student Robotics power
board. Do not tamper with the cable, or power any other electronics with the
battery.

During operation, the battery is protected by over-current protection and a fuse
in the power board. If any equipment is short circuited, the over-current
protection will activate - protecting the battery. In extreme circumstances the
fuse may blow to prevent damage to the battery. This is an important safety
feature: do **not**, under any circumstances, bypass the fuse. The fuse is not
user serviceable and if the fuse has blown then the power board must be replaced.

Mechanical damage to a battery can be dangerous, and a puncture or large force
applied to a battery causes a serious risk of fire. To avoid this, your battery
should be shielded from mechanical damage while you operate it. Secure your
battery to your robot, so that it does not move or fall off while the robot
moves (we provide velcro to help this). You should also build a compartment for
the battery to be placed in, so that accidental collisions do not damage the
battery.

### Flat Batteries

When the battery has been almost completely discharged, the Power Board will
automatically turn off and the LED marked "Power / Flat Battery Indicator"
in the [diagram](/docs/kit/power_board#BoardDiagram) will flash red and green.
You should
immediately disconnect the battery, and begin charging it. You should keep
your second battery charged, so that you can immediately switch to using it.

Do not store a discharged
battery for more than a few days without charging it, as it may discharge
further and become damaged.

Charging Batteries
------------------

Student Robotics provides two different kinds of chargers with our kit, the
[iMAX B6](/docs/kit/batteries/imax_b6_charger), and the
[HobbyKing HKE4](/docs/kit/batteries/hke4_charger). You should only use the battery
charger provided by Student Robotics to charge the batteries provided in the
kit. For precise instructions on how to charge your batteries with the provided
charger, please see the charger specific documentation page, observing the
following precautions:

<div class="warning">
<p>
LiPo batteries can get hot or catch fire when charging and in use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never leave in use or charging batteries unattended</li>
  <li>Always place the battery in the provided charging bag, and ensure the velcro is sealed</li>
  <li>Always follow the charging checklist precisely to make sure the charger is correctly configured</li>
  <li>Leave the charging leads connected to the battery charger at all times</li>
  <li>Do not charge a damaged battery</li>
</ul>
