# Kit

The Student Robotics kit is lent, free of charge, to each team and consists of various modules designed by us along with some ancillary parts to allow easy use of the modules.
All of the kit, except the wire, needs to be returned after the competition.


## The Modules

We provide modules, known as 'boards', in each kit.
These modules can be plugged together and as a whole form the basis for controlling your robot.
The boards provided are as follows; more details can be found on their individual pages.

 * [Brain Board](/docs/kit/brain_board)
 * [Power Board](/docs/kit/power_board)
 * [Motor Board x2](/docs/kit/motor_board)
 * [Arduino (including two screw shields)](/docs/kit/arduino)
 * [Servo Board](/docs/kit/servo_board)


## Ancillary Parts

As well as the boards the kit also contains the following items.
