# Available Python Libraries

If you wish to use a library that isn't in the list, get in contact with us on Discord and have a chat with us about it.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
Note that for local development in the simulator you will need to install the libraries yourself.
Look at the guide on [setting up the simulator]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/setting_up_simulator) to find out how to do this.

## Robot Kit

The following python libraries are installed and available for use in your robot's software:

## Simulator differences

Generally we will try to keep the libraries available in the simulator the same as what is available on the physical robot.
The list below outlines the differences.

<!-- cspell:disable -->
* `debugpy` is not available in the simulator
* `flask` is not available in the simulator
* `opencv` is not available in the simulator
* `sr-robot3` that comes with the simulator has the same API but is different to the one available on pypi
