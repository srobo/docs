# Pit Rules

In order to ensure everybody remains safe at the competitions, there are a few rules we require everyone to adhere to whilst in the venue.

To provide a safe environment in which to use tools, we have a dedicated tools area, which offers additional PPE and equipment to clamp down your work.

## General Rules

- No battery charging in the pits.
  Visit Helpdesk to swap discharged batteries for charged ones
- No running inside the venue, especially when carrying your robot or anything sharp
- Keep the floor area in your pits clear, as much as possible, especially when your pit is unattended
- Avoid blocking or restricting walkways
- Drinks or other liquids must have lids
- Do not damage the tables or the venue

## Tools Rules

- Take all necessary precautions and consider your surroundings before using a tool.
  The use of gloves and eye protection, where appropriate, is strongly encouraged
- Tools must be made safe when unattended — disconnect power sources, cover sharp edges etc.
- Robots must have their batteries removed before tools are used
- Robot batteries are not allowed in the dedicated tools area. These should be left in pits whilst working in the dedicated tools area
- Only permitted tools may be used in the venue. See below for details on what these are and where these can be used

Though not an exhaustive list, you are permitted to use the following tools within your pits:
