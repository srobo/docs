# Safety Regulations

To maintain safety at the competition, all robots at the event are required to pass a safety check. Robots that do not comply to these rules will not be permitted to compete.

<div class="info">
  These regulations do not apply to the Virtual League.
</div>

These regulations are intended to identify a base level of safety — the inspector will use their own judgement and common sense when assessing your robot, and your robot may be judged to be unsafe for reasons or features not listed.

The regulations can be found in the [rulebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules/).

We recommend that you bear these regulations in mind during development too, although it’s not always possible to meet them while building and testing your robot.
