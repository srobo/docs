Introduction
============

This documentation explains how to use the kit and the robot's Python API.
The information is spread across multiple sections:

- The [kit](/docs/kit/) section will give you an overview of the physical kit that is provided to your team, how to connect to each board and what features they have.
- The [programming](/docs/programming/) section talks through how to write code that interacts with all the boards.
- The [simulator](/docs/simulator/) section explains how to use the simulator for testing your code and exploring strategies.
- The [rules](/docs/rules/) section is important as it talks through the aim of this year's game and what task you are trying to achieve.
- [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/) are a series of guides that will help you get started.

Within this documentation, you will come across a number of boxes like this:

~~~~~ python
# code example
~~~~~

These are pieces of example code that you can run on your robot.

From time to time, you may come across some warnings such as the following:

<div class="warning">Never leave batteries unattended when they are in use or charging.</div>

You should take note of these, they often contain important safety information.

You will also come across some blue boxes providing key bits of information, similar to the following:

<div class="info">
Taking images while moving will cause them to be blurry, which will cause marker detection to fail.
Try pausing movement while taking an image.
</div>

These contain useful tips that will help you when building your robot.
