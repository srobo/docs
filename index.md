Introduction
============

There are a number of sections in the documentation,
 offering help for the [kit](/docs/kit/) and [programming](/docs/programming/).
Under the [tutorials](/docs/tutorials/) section,
 a number of these things are combined to help you understand what you can,
 or need, to do.
 Navigation of the documentation can be done using the column to the left,
 where everything is arranged alphabetically in the aforementioned sub-sections.


Within this documentation, you will come across a number of boxes like this:

~~~~~ python
# code example
~~~~~

These are code examples provided to help you.

From time to time,
 you may come across some warnings such as the following:

<div class="warning">Charge Your Batteries!</div>

It would be advisable to take note of these,
 especially that one! You will also come across some blue boxes providing information,
 similar to the following:

<div class="info">Some useful information... like the information given in the information box above.</div>
