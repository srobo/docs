# Student Robotics Documentation

The Student Robotics public documentation.

## Getting Started

For ease of setup, a Docker container is provided. Install Docker and `docker-compose`, then run `docker compose up`.

Once setup, the site will be accessible on http://localhost:4000/docs/

### Manual

1. [Clone this repo][clone-repo]

1. [Install Ruby][install-ruby]

2. Install Bundler (2.3 or above) and Rake

    ``` shell
    $ gem install bundler rake
    ```

3. Start the app in development mode

    ```shell

## Making changes

When you've made a change, either push it to a forked repository, or to a
feature branch, and [raise a pull request][raise-a-pr].

### Navigation Sidebar

The docs navigation sidebar is generated from `_data/sidebar_tree.yaml` as part
of the build process. This file is manually updated so that we can
explicitly control which files are included, in what order as well as adjust the
page titles.
