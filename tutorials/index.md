# Tutorials


## Getting started

The best place to start with your kit is the [kit assembly]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/assembly) guide which shows you how to connect up your kit.
This along with the [Basic Motor Control]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/basic_motor_control) page should be enough to get your robot moving.
