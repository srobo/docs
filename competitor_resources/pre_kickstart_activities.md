# Pre-Kickstart Activities

The pre-Kickstart activities were first included for SR2025 to introduce the concepts of autonomous robotics that can be completed prior to receiving your kit or this year's game being announced. They use our simulator for a set of activities intended to be completed between registration and Kickstart. These will teach some core concepts of robotics and introduce some basic sensors that teams could use on their physical robots.

We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other.
If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).

This year's activities will be available shortly and we will contact all team supervisors when they are released.
