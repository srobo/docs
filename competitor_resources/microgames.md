# Microgames

The microgames are way of getting familiar with your kit through a series of small challenges.


We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other. If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).

The Microgames for the SR2024 competition will be released at Kickstart.
