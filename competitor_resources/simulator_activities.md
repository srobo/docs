# Simulator Activities

We have created a set of activities to introduce the concepts of autonomous robotics that can be completed prior to receiving your kit or this year's game being announced.
They use a special version of our simulator for a set of activities intended to be completed between registration and Kickstart.
These will teach some core concepts of robotics and introduce some basic sensors that teams could use on their physical robots.

We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other.
If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).

This year's activities will be available shortly and we will contact all team supervisors when they are released.

## The Simulated Robot

The robot used for the pre-Kickstart activities differs from the robot used in the regular simulator to have more of a focus on sensing the environment around the robot and lacks any mechanisms for picking up other objects.

All sensors attached to the Arduino are the same, but there are no servos on this robot.

## Example Game: Tin Can Rally

To allow us to demonstrate the utility of various sensors, the simulator is set up for a game called Tin Can Rally.
In this game, the robot must navigate around a course avoiding the tin cans placed around the course.
