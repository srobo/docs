Python
======

Student Robotics robots are all programmed in [Python](http://www.python.org);
to program a robot, it is important that you have a basic understanding of Python.

There are a number of tutorials out there which might help you to learn to program in Python:

* [Our tutorial](/docs/tutorials/python), called _Python: A whirlwind tour_.
    This was written especially for Student Robotics competitors,
    and explains the basics while trying not to overwhelm you.

* [The Official Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) -- the good stuff starts at chapter 3,
    but you should at least skim the stuff before it;
    there is a lot there and it may be a little overwhelming.

* A number of tutorials for beginners are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).
    [Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python_en:Functions) seems like a good one.

* A number of tutorials for people that have programmed before are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers).
    [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html)
    is a good book for people that have programmed before, but it is a fairly long read.

* [The Official Docs](http://docs.python.org/2.7/), for the version of python on the [Odroid Brain Boards](/docs/kit/brain_board).
    We also host a [copy](/docs/python) of docs for the precise version (2.7.5) that it uses.
