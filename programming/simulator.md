The SR Simulator
================

The SR robot simulator allows you to try out programming ideas with a virtual robot in a virtual arena.
The virtual robot has a simple grabber and two motors (configured for skid steering).
Its programming interface is very similar to that for your real robot (see the [Interface section](#Interface)).

<div class="warning">
	While the simulator's interface attempts to be as realistic as possible, it will not be identical to that of your actual robot.
	It is therefore highly unlikely that code which works in the simulator will work in the real world without modification.
	There is no substitute for real-world testing!
</div>

Installation
------------

Follow the instructions for your platform:

* [Windows](#Windows)
* [Linux](#Linux)
* [Mac OS X](#MacOSX)

### [Windows](#Windows) {#Windows}

First, download [the Windows ZIP][windows-zip] and extract it.
In the ZIP you will find a directory called `Portable Python`, which contains `PyScripter-Portable.exe`. Double click this to open the PyScripter development environment.

Open the file named `run.py` in the `robot-sim` folder. This program allows you to launch the simulator.
To try it out, run it (by clicking the green play icon on the toolbar, or pressing Ctrl+F9).
A dialog box will ask you for a program name. Enter `test.py` and press ENTER.
A test program will run in a simulated arena.
(You may need to bring the simulator window to the front by clicking on it in your taskbar.)

To create your own program, click File > New. The new file should contain the
code you need to get started. Write your code as normal. Save the file in the
`robot-sim` folder on your Desktop.

To run your program, run `run.py`, like you did before. Enter the name of your
code file (including the `.py`) into the dialog box and press ENTER.

### [Linux](#Linux) {#Linux}

First, download [the Linux ZIP][linux-zip] and extract it.

The simulator requires three libraries: [pygame][], [PyPyBox2D][], and [PyYAML][].
The easiest way to install these is through your distribution's package manager (although PyPyBox2D is only available through `pip`).
For example, on Ubuntu, you might run the following commands (the Python development tools are required for `pip` to install PyPyBox2D):

~~~~~ bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-pygame python-yaml
$ sudo pip install pypybox2d
~~~~~

To run a test program, open a terminal in the `robot-sim` directory from the ZIP and run:

~~~~~ bash
$ python run.py test.py
~~~~~

To create your own program, write it in a text file using your favourite editor and save it in the `robot-sim` directory. Run it by replacing `test.py` in the previous command with the file name.

### [Mac OS X](#MacOSX) {#MacOSX}

First, download [the Mac OS X ZIP][macosx-zip] and extract it. All files referred to here are in the `robot-sim` folder from that ZIP.

To install the prerequisites for the simulator, run `install-macosx.command`.

You may find that you will need to alter your security settings to allow our software to run on your computer. You can do this in System Preferences in the Security & Privacy section and allow running apps from anywhere. You will also need to make sure that you have [Homebrew][homebrew] installed.

To run a program in the simulator, run `run-macosx.command`, and enter the names of the files you wish to run, separated by commas.
To test it out, enter `test.py` and press ENTER. A test program will run in a simulated arena.

To create your own program, enter it into a text file and save it in
`robot-sim`. Write your code as normal, and run in the same way.

[Interface](#Interface) {#Interface}
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the simulator's API is the same as the real SR API described in the docs.

### Motors

Motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number.

### Servos

Servos are not supported in the simulator.

### The Grabber

Instead of servos, the robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

~~~~~ python
success = R.grab()
~~~~~

The `R.grab` method returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

### Vision

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has the following attributes:

info
:   a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. Has the following attributes:

    code
    :   the numeric code of the marker.

    marker_type
    :   the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN` or `MARKER_ARENA`).

    offset
    :   offset of the numeric code of the marker from the lowest numbered marker of its type.
        For example: markers 28 and 29, which are the lowest numbered markers that represent robots, have offsets of 0 and 1 respectively.

    size
    :   the size that the marker would be in the real game (in metres), for compatibility with the SR API.

centre
:   the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:

    length
    :   the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).

    rot_y
    :   rotation about the Y axis in degrees.

dist
:   an alias for `centre.length`

res
:   the value of the `res` parameter of `R.see`, for compatibility with the SR API.

rot_y
:   an alias for `centre.rot_y`

timestamp
:   the time at which the marker was seen (when `R.see` was called).

For example, the following code lists all of the markers the robot can see:

~~~~~ python
markers = R.see()
print "I can see", len(markers), "markers:"

for m in markers:
    if m.info.marker_type == MARKER_TOKEN:
        print " - Token {0} is {1} metres away".format(m.info.offset, m.dist)
    elif m.info.marker_type == MARKER_ARENA:
        print " - Arena marker {0} is {1} metres away".format(m.info.offset, m.dist)
