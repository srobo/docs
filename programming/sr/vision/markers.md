Markers
=======

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/content/marker-0.png" alt="An Example Marker: Arena marker 0" class="right" />
An example *libkoki* marker is given to the right; this one is *arena-0*.
There is a dot in the top-left corner of the black border.  This corner is known as the *principal corner*, and its location is important if measuring the marker's orientation about the Z-axis.
There is also some text in the bottom-left corner of the black border.
This text will say something like `"libkoki marker #0 (v0.5) 'ARENA'"`.
Let's break that down:
`#0` means marker number 0;
`(v0.5)` tells you the version of the marker, it is important the latest version is used; and
`'ARENA'` is just a human-readable description of what the marker is for.

<div class="info">A link to download the SR2017 markers will be added to this page once the game has been announced.</div>

Note that a different set of markers will be used for the competition (by adding 100 to all of the markers above).
This is not something you need to worry about, though.
We will handle this for you when your robot is started in a competition mode.

The white space around the markers is very important -- without it, the markers probably won't be recognised.
If the markers become damaged (scuff markers, tears, etc...) they will not function as well (if at all).
If this happens, it is best to just print another one.
