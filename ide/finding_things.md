Finding things in the IDE
=========================

Even when organised neatly into [projects](/docs/IDE/creating_a_project),
it can sometimes be hard to remember exactly where a particular piece of
code or comment is.
To help with this, the IDE has a search function that can look through
all of your code as well as file and project names.

How to search
-------------

Searches are done using the search page, which can be launched from the
shortcuts menu.

 "The Search option on the shortcuts menu.")

Initially, the search page will just have some search controls.
You can start a search using the button, or by pressing enter once you've typed a query.

Searches will look for the entire phrase, appearing exactly as typed,
anywhere in the name of a project, a file or in the content of a file.
Results will appear incrementally as they are found,
and will be categorised by where they were found.

For example, the following search for "bacon" found a project,
a file and several mentions inside files:

 "Mmm, bacon.")
