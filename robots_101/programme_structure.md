# Robots 101 - Programme Structure

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for people aged 16-19.
But what actually happens during the course of the competition year?

## Registration

Registration for the competition usually opens in early September. Teams usually
consist of 4-8 competitors attending a school or college, though other groups
are also free to enter. Your team must have a responsible adult who will oversee
the team (a role we call the [team supervisor][team-supervisor]) and they must
be the person to [sign up][sign-up].

While places are free (thanks to our [sponsors][sponsors]), they are limited.
You will be notified whether or not your team has received a place shortly
before the start of the competition year.

We also provide some [pre-kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities] which
teach some core concepts of robotics making use of our [simulator][simulator]
and introduce some simple sensors that you could use on your physical robots.

## Kickstart

Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year. The structure of the
competition and the [game rules][rules] are announced and any questions you have
will be answered.

Typically this is a one day in-person event in October (usually a Saturday).
Throughout the day there are Blueshirts (our awesome volunteers!) around in
person, ready to answer any questions and to help you through the
[microgames][microgames]. The microgames help you become familiar with the
[kit][kit] which is loaned to all teams and should kickstart some ideas for your
robot’s design.

## Mentoring

Shortly after Kickstart we aim to pair up teams with a volunteer mentor who can
guide the team and help them with any technical questions. Where possible the
mentor will join the team's meetings in person, though we also offer remote
mentors if that is not possible.

All teams also have access to our [Discord][discord] server where they can chat
with all our volunteers (as well as other teams) at any time.

## Your time

Most teams work on their robot for at least two hours a week, with some teams
spending four hours or more. How this time is scheduled varies between teams --
some have more than one meeting a week, others have less frequent but longer
sessions.

To get the most out of the time, ensure sessions are long enough to make useful
progress after allowing for setting up beforehand and tidying away afterwards.

## Tech Days

Throughout the year [Tech Days][tech-days] provide opportunities to spend a
whole day (usually a Saturday) working on your robot, with lots of help
available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get
more direct help with your robot.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help with the kits and hands-on guidance with your robot.

## Virtual Competition

The Virtual Competition is often the first change you'll have to test your
strategies against other teams. You'll submit your robot code for running
against other teams in the [simulator][simulator]. The matches are livestreamed
on our [YouTube Channel][youtube] and you'll get a copy of your robot's logs
afterwards so you can continue to improve it.

## Competition

The Competition event is a two day event in spring. It's the ultimate test for
your robot in a weekend of tinkering and matches.

You'll have a team pit for you to work in, with power and internet access, and
throughout the weekend there are volunteers around to help with the kits and
hands-on guidance with your robot. We also provide a test arena which you can
use to check the improvements you're making to your robot.

Typically there are blocks of league matches on the Saturday and on Sunday
morning, with time to improve your robot between appearances. On Sunday
afternoon you'll advance into the knockout stages, and can go on to win prizes.
