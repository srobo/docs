# Robots 101 - Events

There are three types of event which are held through the [competition year][structure]:

* [Kickstart][kickstart]
* [Tech Days][tech-days]
* [Competition][competition]

All events are listed in the [events calendar][events-calendar] on our website.
The event page for each one contain details of when & where they are, along with
anything specific you'll need for the day. Generally you will be provided with
power and internet access, as well as a space to work on your robot, though each
event is different so be sure to check the event pages.

All teams attending an event **must** be accompanied by a responsible adult.
This person will typically be the primary Team Supervisor, however does not need
to be. In cases where this role is delegated, we require only that:

* the person is someone the primary contact is aware of and happy to act as [Team Supervisor][team-supervisor] in their stead at the event:
  * over the age of 18
  * not a competitor
  * able to take responsibility for all their competitors at the event, as well as any equipment brought by the team
* the primary contact inform us who the person is ahead of the event and provide a mobile phone number which we can use to contact them if needed

For events which have dedicated sign-up forms (usually this is just Tech Days),
we usually include a way to indicate who will be responsible for the competitors.
Otherwise, or if your plans change, please [email us](mailto:{{ site.emails.teams }}).
