# Robots 101 - Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for your team to spend a whole day working on your
robot, with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robot.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help with the kits and hands-on guidance with your robot.

## What to work on

Tech Days typically do not have a fixed set of activities. Instead, what you
work on during the day is up to you. Some teams use Tech Days as an opportunity
to generally work on their robot, while others focus on a specific task they
want to achieve or get help with. You probably do want to have an idea of what
you'd like to achieve before the day though!

Teams' focus at Tech Days also varies with when the Tech Day falls within the
competition year. Early on this might mean choosing the components, initial
robot assembly or completing one of the Challenges. Later on this might mean
integrating all the sensors & actuators into a fully working robot or finessing
your robot's interactions with the arena.

## What to bring

Exactly what you should bring to each Tech Day varies by event and where the
event is hosted, so you should always **check the event page for details**. That
being said, in most cases you'll want:

* Your _robot_, no matter how many pieces it's in and including any spare parts you have
* A _laptop with a USB-A port_ (don't forget the charger)
* Some _hand-tools_ to work on your kit
* Your _Team Supervisor_ or another (non-competitor) responsible adult

Some venues may allow you to bring things like _power tools_ and _paint_ or
_glue_, however not all will. Sometimes you may also need to bring a _packed
lunch_. Always be sure to check the event pages for details.

## How to attend

Tech Days are listed in the [events calendar][events-calendar] on our website.
The event page for each one contain details of when & where they are, along with
anything specific you'll need for the day.

Your Team Supervisor can sign up for your team to attend as many as you like,
however in cases where events are over-subscribed we will try to ensure that
everyone has the opportunity to attend at least one Tech Day throughout the
year. Be sure to also read our general information about [events][events] when
signing up.
