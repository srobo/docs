Getting Code on the Robot
=========================

<div class="info">
It is possible to plug the memory stick into your robot after it has been turned on.
You can also pull the stick out of your robot while it's powered up, change the code and plug it back in.
The new code should load and will run when you press the button.
</div>

To get the code onto your robot, you'll need to use a memory stick formatted with <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> or <abbr title="NT File System">NTFS</abbr> (the most common file systems used on memory sticks), such as the one provided for you in your kit.

You should transfer your code to the memory stick, and then the memory stick is plugged into the robot's USB hub.

Now you can turn on your robot (or kit) and press the _run_ button. Errors and the output of your `print` statements will be written to [the log file](/docs/troubleshooting/python#ReadingTheLogs). You can also view the log output live by connecting to your robot's [WiFi](/docs/kit/wifi).

<div class="info">
To re-run your program, simply remove the USB stick and plug it back in again. There's no need to restart the robot.
