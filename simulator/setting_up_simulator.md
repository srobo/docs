Setting up the simulator
========================

### Prerequisites

You need to download and install [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#download) (the download is around 300MB).
This is the platform we run our simulation in.

Version "R2023b" of Webots is supported.

#### Python Version

You will also need Python installed.

| Platform | Supported Python Version |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Windows  | 3.8-3.11 (64-bit)        |
| macOS    | 3.8-3.11                 |
| Linux    | 3.8-3.11                 |

There are a small number of [external libraries]({{ site.baseurl }}/kit/brain_board/python_libraries) which will be available to your robot code during the competition.
Note that for local development you will need to install these yourself.

### Installing the simulation

1. Create a directory, perhaps called `simulation` where you will store your robot code.
2. [Download the simulation](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator/releases/download/sr2024.0/competition-simulator-sr2024.0.zip), the latest version is `sr2024.0`, released on 2023-10-17, which is a preview to aid in setting up the simulator. The simulation for the SR2024 competition will be released at Kickstart.
3. Unzip the simulation as a subdirectory of the directory you created in the first step:
    ```
    simulation
    ├── competition-simulator-<version>
    │   ├── ...
    │   └─ worlds
    │       └── Arena.wbt
    └── robot.py
    ```
    If there is not an existing `robot.py` an example one will be created when the simulator first runs.

4. Using the Webots IDE, open the `worlds/Arena.wbt` file.

You may receive a warning about your computer's GPU not being good enough, which can be ignored.

  On recent versions of macOS you may need to give Webots permission to access the directory where you have extracted the simulation files.

#### Changing your version of Python

If webots is not picking any version of Python or is picking up the wrong one then you'll need to change it.
When this happens Webots will print errors to its console and your robot will not move.

You will need the full path to the version of Python that you want to use.
This will vary based on the system you have.
One way to find the path is by launching the version of Python that you want to
use and running the following code:

~~~~~ python
import sys
print(sys.executable)
~~~~~

On Windows you can set the path to the Python version to use in Webots UI via
**Tools** &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **General** &rarr; **Python command**.
Your Python path is likely similar to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe` when using Python 3.11, where `<USERNAME>` is your login.

On Mac you can set the path to the Python version to use via **Webots** &rarr; **Preferences** <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>.
Your Python path is likely similar to `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3` when using Python 3.11.

You'll need to ensure a matching version of Python is installed. If you're still
having problems, ask for help in [`#simulator-help`][simulator-help] in
[Discord][discord].

### Updates

Occasionally, we may release an update to the simulation. To update, you will need to delete the `competition-simulator-<version>` directory, and re-download it using the above link.

If you need a specific version of the simulator, or want to see what changes
have been made with each version, please see the
[list of releases](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator/releases).
