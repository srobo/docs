User Settings in the IDE
========================

The IDE contains a small number of behaviours that can be configured via user set preferences.
These can be changed on the settings page of the IDE,
which also offers descriptions of what each one does.

The settings page is available via the [shortcuts menu](/docs/IDE/shortcuts_menu) in the tab-bar:

 "The User Settings option on the shortcuts menu.")

Some settings are only available (and will otherwise appear disabled)
when you select a given option in another setting.
One example of this is the *Project to load* setting,
whose value only has any meaning if you select "Specify manually" in the *Project Autoload* setting.

Don't forget to save your settings after making any changes!
